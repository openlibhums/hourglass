          Birkbeck, University of London to ensure that OLH is truly
          scholar-led.</p>
          <p>Our founders use their research time at Birkbeck to advance
          scholarship on open access and the politics of collective action.
          Co-founder Prof. Martin Paul Eve researches scholarly
          communications in books such as <i>Theses on the Metaphors of
          Digital-Textual History</i> (2024) and <i>Open Access and the
          Humanities</i> (2014). Co-founder Dr Caroline Edwards has 15 years'
          experience publishing her research and building academic networks
          in the humanities, including setting up new journals and scholarly
          research associations, and working with editors to enshrine community
          ownership of journals.</p>
          <p>This specialism extends to our wider organisation. Our team
          uses their doctorates in humanities subjects to steer robust and
          quality open-access research to publication. We also continue our
          scholar-led tradition through user experience (UX) research into what our users
          want, continually improving our software to put scholars in
          charge.</p>
