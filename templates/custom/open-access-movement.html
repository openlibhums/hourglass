            <p>Our work at the OLH builds on decades of internet activism.
            Since the availability of public internet in the 1990s, scientists
            have been self-archiving their work to provide access to scholarly
            research. The dream of unrestricted online access to scholarly
            journal articles, which became known as the open-access movement,
            took shape in the early 2000s as scholars, librarians, and
            funders began to build co-operative networks and platforms.</p>

          <h2 id="serials-crisis">“Serials crisis”</h2>
          <p class="font-semibold">The open-access movement emerged against
          the backdrop of what is referred to as “the serials crisis” in
          scholarly publishing. Since the 1970s, the number of published
          academic journals has rapidly increased — beyond the capacity of
          small-scale university presses. As universities outsourced the
          publishing of their work to commercial publishing companies, who
          became more wealthy and powerful in the process, journal
          subscription packages (known as serials) began to cripple
          university library budgets.</p>
          <p>Libraries could no longer afford to subscribe to the journals
          their own scholars had set up, despite much of the labour of
          writing, peer reviewing, and editing these articles being done on a
          voluntary basis by the academics themselves. Meanwhile, the profit
          margins of <a
          href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0127502#pone-0127502-g007">publishing
          giants grew</a> beyond those of oil companies and in line with the
          world's most profitable pharmaceutical company, Pfizer. This has been made possible
          by appropriating public funds from universities. Elsevier, for
          example, recorded <a
            href="https://www.theguardian.com/science/2017/jun/27/profitable-business-scientific-publishing-bad-for-science">profits
          of more than 40%</a> in 2012 and 2013, which is higher than Apple,
          Google, and Amazon.</p>
          <p>Open access (OA) has the potential to disrupt this commercial
          model. If scholarly journals are freely available on the public
          internet for anyone to read, publishers lose their subscription
          income. In reaction, and to meet public demand for open access,
          commercial publishers have shifted the cost of publishing back onto
          academic authors. In effect, what has emerged is an open-access
          pay-to-publish model.</p>
          <p>This has profoundly anti-democratic consequences, which
          disadvantages scholars in the Global South, precarious scholars,
          and scholars working in disciplines that are under-funded (which
          affects the humanities, in particular).</p>

            What is diamond open access?
          </h2>
          <p class="font-semibold">The costs of open-access publication need to
          be paid for somehow. The best-known routes to achieving this are
          “gold” and “green” OA. Both models can be problematic.</p>
          <p>“Gold” open access makes articles available immediately on
          publication, without paywalls. However, publishing companies derive
          profits by shifting costs to authors or institutions through article
          processing charges (APCs). The problem: this is still a corporate
          model of publication and, with government pushing for this model of
          open access, it easily aligns with wider fears about the
          neoliberalisation of universities. This can end up shaping the debate
          about open access, and the community-driven history of the movement
          risks being defined out of existence.</p>
          <p>On the other hand, “green” open access refers to authors
          publishing in traditional, paywall journals but then self-archiving
          their work to make it publicly available. The problem: access is
          often delayed because of an embargo set at the request of the
          publisher, which means they continue to profit because paid
          subscriptions continue to be necessary.</p>
          <p>Unlike “green” or “gold” models, “diamond” open access has the
          potential to meaningfully disrupt the profit margins of commercial
          publishers. With diamond open access, non-commercial, not-for-profit
          organisations and community networks make material available free of
          charge to both authors and readers. In our diamond model, fair
          support from a large pool of scholarly institutions means that we can
          publish articles that are free to readers to access and free for
          authors to publish.</p>
          <p>With government mandates, many humanities academics feel that they
          are having “openness violently thrust upon them”; diamond open
          access, OLH co-founder <a
          href="https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/blog/2013/mar/25/open-access-humanities-future">Martin
          Paul Eve reasons</a>, is a means for academics to “re-seize some
          limited agency” and shape the direction of scholarly publishing. Rather
          than “have things solely done to us,” it allows us to be “active
          participants” in our own destinies and those of our scholarly
          communities.</p>
