            The library partnership subsidy model.
          </h2>
          <p>The OLH was one of the first publishers in Europe to launch a
          library membership network at the beginnings of the diamond open-access
          movement in 2015.</p>
          <p>We worked with library colleagues for 2 years before launching our
          Library Partnership Subsidy model to find an alternative to
          commercial journal subscriptions. This was informed by the shared
          belief that Article Processing Charges (APCs) and Transformative
          Agreements (TAs) for funding open-access publishing are unaffordable
          and unfair. They don’t work for humanities scholars and perpetuate
          publishing legacies that privilege wealthier institutions in the
          Global North at the expense of scholars working in the Global
          South.</p>
          <p>The OLH provides a sustainable alternative to the “author-pays”
          model. More than 340 university and public libraries worldwide have
          joined the OLH to date, diverting small sums from their open-access
          budgets to fund our journals. Increasing funding to scholar-led and
          not-for-profit alternatives strengthens libraries’ bargaining power
          with large commercial publishers. This puts pressure on these
          publishers to adopt more transparent business models and reduce their
          fees to reflect the realities of library budgets.</p>

          <p>Because we are not-for-profit and have brought our publishing
          technology in house, we can offer extremely cost-effective diamond
          open-access publishing.
          <p>It’s cheaper for your library to join the OLH and pay an annual
          membership, which funds the publication of 500 articles across
          30 journals each year,
          than to pay a single Article Processing Charge
          (APC) to publish one article open access with a legacy publisher.
          (Typically, it costs a humanities researcher c.£2,500 / €2,894 /
          $3,067 for an APC to publish their journal article open access with a
          publisher whose profits derive from library subscriptions).</p>
          <p>By contrast, OLH membership starts from as little as £750 / $916 /
          €861 per year. Keeping our basic membership rates low helps libraries
          keep their costs under control. Our fees are banded by country, and
          we have higher-tier membership rates available at bronze, silver,
          gold, and platinum levels for libraries operating with larger
          budgets. Our model works from each according to their ability, to
          each according to their needs.</p>

          <p>Over 340 university and public libraries worldwide already support
          us, which makes our platform safe and sustainable. As this support
          grows, we expand our portfolio of humanities journals by “flipping”
          subscription titles. This provides a route to diamond open access
          that is affordable and sustainable.</p>
          <p>We also invest in building open-source publishing technologies
          that benefit the entire academic community. Investing in our own
          publishing platform means we can offer cutting-edge technology to our
          journals at a sustainable cost for our international library
          partners. It also safeguards the OLH against acquisition, ensuring
          our ongoing independence from commercial publishers.</p>

          <p>The OLH model has been built around the specific needs of
          humanities scholars. It works because we are embedded in the academic
          communities that we serve. Our model harnesses support from libraries
          and funders to protect niche fields and preserve research cultures
          that are at risk from austerity cuts to humanities research
          funding.</p>
          <p>It is also grounded in an understanding that humanities
          disciplines face specific challenges. They are often poorly funded
          and less likely to benefit from research investment than the
          sciences. Postgraduates, independent scholars, less
          “research-intensive” institutions, and academics in the Global South
          are also disproportionately disadvantaged by an “author pays” system
          of open-access publishing.</p>
          <p>Our model has been influential in the shift towards
          community-governed, not-for-profit open-access publishing because it
          addressed these issues. And it continues to work because we are
          aligned with the mission of libraries. Despite competitive market
          forces, we work in partnership with our library network to maximise
          societal access to research in the broadest sense.</p>
