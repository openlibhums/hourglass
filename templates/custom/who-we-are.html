          <p class="font-semibold">The OLH launched as an international movement of
          scholars, librarians, programmers, and publishers in 2013. Co-founders Dr
          Caroline Edwards and Professor Martin Paul Eve wanted to rebuild an
          unfair system in which corporate publishers make huge profits from
          publicly funded research by selling it back to universities in
          subscription packages.</p>
          <p>Martin and Caroline began working together, building on their
          respective visions for open access. By 2015, the Open Library of
          Humanities had become a scholar-led publisher offering a not-for-profit
          route to open access. The OLH challenged commercial academic publishing,
          which adopted an “author-pays” model of open access, passing the
          cost of publication onto authors to recoup lost subscriptions.</p>
          <p>Too often, publishing companies profit from our scholarship and
          editorial labour, whilst university and library budgets are squeezed. We
          built an organisation around the passionately held belief that academic
          research should be made available to anyone with an internet
          connection.</p>
