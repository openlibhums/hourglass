          <p>The following policies apply to all Open Library of Humanities

          <h3 id="open-access">Open-access policy.</h3>
          <p>Our journals provide immediate access to their content on the
          principle that making research freely available to the public
          supports a greater global exchange of knowledge. Authors of published
          articles remain the copyright holders and grant third parties the
          right to use, reproduce, and share the article according to a
          <a href="https://creativecommons.org/share-your-work/cclicenses/">Creative
            Commons</a> license agreement. In some exceptional
          cases, copyright holders for articles published in journals that
          migrate to the OLH may differ for back content published prior to the
          journal joining the OLH.</p>
          <p>One of the benefits of open-access publishing lies in others being
          able to re-use material. We believe that the greatest societal good
          is possible when people are free to re-distribute scholarship and to
          create derivative works. This is why we use the
          <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/">CC
          BY 4.0</a> license, under which others
          may re-use your work, on condition that they cite you.</p>
          <p>If a more restrictive licence is required (for example, if you are
          reproducing third party material that cannot be reproduced under more
          open licences), please make this request upon submission in the
          ‘Comment to the Editor’ field or email your editor directly, stating
          the reasons why.</p>
          <h3 id="anti-plagiarism">Anti-plagiarism checking.</h3>
          <p>A combination of pre-screening and open access is the best
          possible defence against plagiarism. All articles submitted to Open
          Library of Humanities (OLH) journals can be screened for plagiarism
          by the iThenticate system from
          <a href="https://www.crossref.org/services/similarity-check/">Crossref</a>. This
          system compares incoming articles to a large database of academic
          content, and alerts editors to any possible issues.</p>
          <h3 id="peer-review">Rigorous peer review.</h3>
          <p>All journals published by the OLH adhere to a rigorous peer-review policy to ensure the integrity of the scholarship we publish. The majority of OLH journals use the double-anonymous peer-review system for submitted articles, with some journals opting for single-anonymous, triple-anonymous or open peer review. The only materials we exempt from the necessity of peer review are editorials, book reviews, conference reports, interviews, and other non-article pieces, which do not require external peer review in order to be published and are subject to editorial review and revisions as required.</p>
          <p>Journal editors are responsible for sourcing potential peer reviewers
          for submitted articles. As a general publisher policy, the OLH does
          not endorse the practice of authors suggesting potential reviewers.
          Although this is an acceptable scholarly practice <a
          href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/flowchart/how-recognise-potential-manipulation-peer-review-process">as
          outlined by COPE</a>, the OLH believes that inviting
          authors to contribute to the review process can potentially lead to
          manipulation and abuse of peer review in some disciplines. The OLH
          therefore understands that for some disciplines the practice of authors
          suggesting potential reviewers is accepted best practice and we can make
          exceptions to this publisher policy for specific journals in
          consultation with journal editorial boards.</p>
          <p>For OLH journals operating an anonymous review policy, authors and
          editors may find it useful to consult the OLH's guide to '<a
          href="/site/anonreview/">Ensuring
          an Anonymous Review</a>'.</p>
          <h3 id="archiving-and-indexing">Archiving and indexing policy.</h3>
          <p>The OLH is committed to ensuring that content is archived and discoverable through archiving, indexing and discovery services.</p>
          <p>OLH journals are, where possible, indexed by the following
          services:</p>

          <p>As of 2025, the OLH is undertaking the ongoing process of indexing
          journals with <a href="https://www.scopus.com/sources.uri">Scopus</a>.</p>
          <p>All OLH content is indexed with <a href="https://www.crossref.org">Crossref</a>
          and assigned a <a href="https://www.doi.org">Digital Object
          Identifier (DOI)</a>. This means that all of our references are made
          available so that citations can be tracked by the publishing 
          community, and the content is added to the iThenticate
          anti-plagiarism database. All journals contain the correct website
          information to be harvested by
          <a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google
            Scholar</a>. In addition, all journals are available for metadata
          harvesting via
          <a href="http://www.openarchives.org/pmh/">OAI-PMH</a> and are registered with <a
            href="http://www.openarchives.org">Open
          Archives</a>.</p>
          <p>Journal content is archived around the world to ensure long-term
          availability. To secure  permanency of all publications, OLH journals
          utilise <a href="https://clockss.org">CLOCKSS</a>,
          and <a href="https://www.lockss.org">LOCKSS</a>
          archiving systems to create permanent archives for the purposes of
          preservation and restoration. Where relevant, we automatically archive
          journal content with subject specific archives.</p>
          <p>If the journal is not indexed by your preferred service, please
          let us know by <a
          href="/contact/">contacting us</a>
          or alternatively by making an indexing request directly with the service and letting the publisher, OLH, know of such requests.</p>
          <h3 id="generative-artificial-intelligence">Generative artificial intelligence.</h3>
          <p>The use of generative artificial intelligence (AI) in scholarly publishing has evolved rapidly, coinciding with the development of better trained AI models and other technological advances. In recognition of the need for clarity on acceptable and unacceptable generative AI uses in academic research, and in all areas of the publishing workflow, we have produced extensive guidance for authors, journal editors and peer reviewers in our <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/ai-policy/">Artificial Intelligence Policy</a>. All parties in the publishing process must consult and follow the content of our AI policy.</p>
          <p>We continue to monitor the latest international scholarly debates and legal frameworks for generative AI use, while consulting the editorial teams of our journals, to reflect a truly community-led, humanities-focussed approach to this nascent but increasingly ubiquitous technology. Our policy on generative AI is an evolving document that draws upon the current legal status of generative AI in terms of authorship, but also considers the impact of generative AI use on research integrity, accessibility, and publication ethics and malpractice.</p>

          <h3 id="academic-standards">Academic standards.</h3>
          <p>Editorials, book reviews, conference reports, interviews, and other non-article pieces, which are the only kinds of articles that may be exempt from the journal’s standard peer-review process, should be clearly marked as such and should still adhere to the publisher’s ethical standards set out below. The publisher will clearly indicate the peer-review process for each article on the article itself, along with the license it has been published under, its DOI, a ‘Competing Interests’ statement, the dates of the article’s acceptance into the journal and publication, and the XML and PDF files for the article available for download. For some journals, articles may also display a 'Data Availability' or 'Data Accessibility' statement as required.</p>
          <h3 id="oa-content">Open access to content.</h3>
          <p>The OLH is dedicated to, and responsible for, maintaining constant open access to content for all our published journals. We are committed to the preservation of academic research and continually review and update established archives and indexing services where possible with the most up-to-date data (see our <a
          href="#archiving-and-indexing">Archiving
          and Indexing</a> policy). Journal content is
          made as accessible and discoverable as possible to external archives and
          indexers, producing machine-readable formats for our published articles
          that software systems, search engines, and other kinds of technology can
          understand. All journals are securely backed up and, should an outage
          occur, they will be restored as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p>The OLH strives to maintain the open access of XML and PDF files
          for all articles, which are openly available for download from an
          article’s webpage if such files exist. Source files for articles,
          such as PDF design files, are <a
          href="/contact/">available
          on request</a> where appropriate, and if we have access to them.</p>
          <p>As members of <a href="https://clockss.org/">CLOCKSS</a>
          (Controlled Lots of Copies Keep Stuff
          Safe), our content is regularly archived with many of the world’s
          leading research libraries. The CLOCKSS archive ensures that OLH
          content will always be made available as open access, in any
          eventuality.</p>
          <p>The OLH seeks the highest standards of <a
          href="/site/accessibility/">accessibility</a>
          for its titles and to be an
          inclusive publisher of research material. To this end, we continually
          work with our partners to update our platform and ensure that we meet
          relevant professional standards. This includes: enabling
          dyslexia-friendly fonts and display characteristics across our
          journal portfolio; providing all of our articles in formats that are
          accessible to those using screen readers; and, building towards full
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web
          Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG 2.2)
          compliance in all of our titles.</p>
          <h3 id="author-name-changes">Author name changes post-publication.</h3>
          <p>In accordance with the <a
          href="/site/guiding-values/">OLH’s
          core values</a> of inclusivity and openness,
          we acknowledge that an author may change their name during their
          career. The OLH will therefore support post-publication author name
          changes where we have the technical capacity to do so (i.e., access
          to PDF source files). This will be actioned without publicly
          announcing these changes via a correction notice. Requesting authors
          will not be asked to provide legal evidence or documentation, nor
          the reason for a name change. However, they may be asked to provide
          evidence that they are the author of the article in question (for
          example, email correspondence relating to the submission or
          revisions). </p>
          <p>Authors requesting a name change should contact the journal’s
          editor by email, which can be found on the journal’s ‘Contact’
          page.</p>
          <h3 id="ethics-policies">Ethics policies for our journals.</h3>
          <h4>i) Complaints and appeals process.</h4>
          <p>The OLH will carefully consider complaints, appeals and
          allegations in line with guidance from the <a
          href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance?query=&sort_by=relevance&f%5B0%5D=type%3A44">Committee
          on Publication Ethics (COPE)</a>. This
          applies both pre- and post-publication.</p>
          <p>When a complaint is made to a journal, it must be passed to the
          journal’s editor, who must then inform the publisher, the OLH, and
          address the issue <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance/flowchart/responding-concerns-raised-directly">following COPE guidelines</a>. Where necessary,
          allegations will be referred to the appropriate institution for
          further investigation. Pending the outcome of an investigation, the
          published record will be updated accordingly, with a post-publication
          notice in the form of either a Correction or a Retraction. This
          notice will be linked to the original article (see 'ii) Options for
          post-publication discussions and corrections' for further details). A
          permanent digital object identifier (DOI) and universal resource
          locator (URL) link between the notice and the original, full article will be made to
          enhance the transparency and integrity of the publication record;
          only in rare cases, where it is in the public interest, will an
          article be removed.</p>
          <p>Well-evidenced appeals to editorial decisions are welcome and will
          be handled by the journal’s editor in the first instance, who will
          assess the appeal’s validity. If valid, the journal’s editorial board
          and/or external peer reviewers will review the appeal. A new
          editorial decision will be made based on the results of this
          review.</p>
          <p><strong>To submit a complaint or raise an issue of potential
            misconduct to a journal, or to appeal an editorial
            decision:</strong></p>
          <ol>
            <li>Contact the journal’s editor with an explanation of your
              complaint or appeal. If you have a complaint regarding the
              editors of a journal, you may, alternatively, address your
              complaint
              <a href="/contact/">directly
                to the publisher</a> by writing;</li>
            <li>If the response to your complaint is not satisfactory, raise
              the matter with the publisher, who will
              investigate the complaint and decide whether a
              further investigation is required, following
              COPE guidelines;</li>
            <li>Please submit complaints or appeals by email, or by visiting the
                journal’s ‘Contact’ page.</li>
          </ol>
          <h4>ii) Options for post-publication discussions and corrections.</h4>
          <p>If a significant error is noticed in a published article and the complaint has been raised through the correct channels and verified as valid, the journal editors must address and resolve this, working with the publisher as required. Where significant post-publication corrections or retractions need to be made, or if an article is to be removed, these will be accompanied by a correction or retraction notice to indicate the incorrect elements of the article and the extent of the corrections made, or the basis for the article’s retraction or removal.</p>
          <p><strong>Correction</strong> notices are issued to address relatively minor errors in the article’s content or changes that have been made to the article’s metadata. To avoid multiple versions of the same article being circulated, these corrections are strictly limited to, for example, errors of spelling and phrasing that affect meaning, data errors, or mis-citations. Depending on the scale of these changes, a formal correction notice may be issued which outlines the precise nature of the necessary corrections, and the original article must be clearly linked to this notice. The editors, in consultation with the publisher, may decide not to issue a formal correction notice if extremely minor errors (such as missing punctuation or a single mis-spelling) have been identified and raised with the journal's editors within 30 days of the article's publication. Such corrections will be made as soon as possible to avoid the proliferation of the incorrect article.</p>
          <p><strong>Retraction</strong> notices are issued for major issues
          affecting the argument or substantive content of an article that a
          correction would otherwise not fix. When a retraction is made,
          following <a
          href="https://publicationethics.org/retraction-guidelines">COPE’s
          Retraction Guidelines</a>, a retraction notice will be issued, linking
          to the original article, which clearly states which
          part(s) of the article are incorrect or unreliable and are therefore the
          basis for the retraction. A ‘Publisher’s Note’ will be added to the
          original article that links readers to the retraction notice.</p>
          <p><strong>Removals</strong> are only to be made in rare
          circumstances, where not doing so would, for example, infringe the copyright of a third party or cause harm. In the case of an article's removal, the contents of the article will be removed from the journal’s site hosted  by the publisher. It will not be downloadable as a file or displayed on the article’s webpage. A notice of retraction will be issued in the same manner as a standard retraction notice, and it will include the reason(s) for the article’s removal. The original article’s metadata will remain and will be linked to the retraction notice.</p>
          <h4>iii) Conflicts of interest/competing interests.</h4>
          <p>The OLH is committed to transparent and bias-free research. To ensure that all publications are as open as possible, all authors, reviewers and editors are required to declare any interests that could appear to compromise, conflict or influence the validity of the publication. This process is in place to reinforce trust in the research data.</p>
          <p>Competing interests must be declared at the point of an article's submission. A conflict of interest must be stated if there is any reason why the information or the interpretation of information being produced may be influenced by a personal or financial relationship with other organisations, individuals, or with the journal. If these relationships could reasonably be perceived as influencing objective data or decision-making, they must be declared. Everyone involved in the submission, editorial processing, peer review and publication should declare any competing interests that they may have as early as possible.</p>
          <p>Competing interests can take the form of both financial and non-financial relationships. The declaration of such relationships helps to ensure that academic rigour is maintained and that publications cannot be accused of undue bias or misinformation.</p>
          <p>Examples of competing interests can be:</p>
          <ul class="browser-default">
            <li>Current editorial involvement with the journal</li>
            <li>Receipt of payment, in any form, from an organisation or
              individual related to the subject matter</li>
            <li>Ownership of stocks or shares in organisations directly related
              to the subject matter</li>
            <li>Receipt of grants or funding</li>
            <li>Membership of relevant boards</li>
            <li>Related patents/applied for patents</li>
            <li>Gifts</li>
            <li>Known relationships that will hinder impartiality (e.g.
              colleagues, family, mentor, previous supervisor/student)</li>
            <li>Political, religious, or ideological interests</li>
            <li>Commercial interests</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Competing interests should generally be declared to cover <i>at least</i> the previous 5 years. This is a minimum requirement, and individuals must declare if they have had a previous relationship with an individual or an organisation relevant to the submission that could be deemed to influence decision making.</p>
          <p>To ensure transparency, neither editors nor board members may be
          involved in editorial decisions about their own scholarly work. Any
          published article that lists editors or board members as authors must
          detail this in a ‘Competing Interests’ statement that follows <a
          href="/site/competing-interests/">OLH
          guidelines on how to declare a competing interest</a>.</p>
          <h4>iv) Data sharing and reproducibility.</h4>
          <p>The OLH is committed to a more open research landscape and
          facilitating access to research by enabling reproducibility. The OLH
          encourages authors of articles published in our journals to share
          their research data where relevant, including, but not limited to,
          raw data, processed data, software, algorithms, protocols, methods,
          and materials. All of our journals follow this ethos, and in many cases have further best practice guidance on data sharing and reproducibility as part of the journal's own policy.</p>
          <h4>v) Intellectual property.</h4>
          <p>Authors with work published in OLH journals retain their copyright but grant the ability for the publisher to disseminate the work under Creative Commons license CC BY 4.0 (and, in very rare circumstances, under other CC licences). Full details are available on the ‘Copyright Notice’ of the ‘Submissions’ page of our journals.</p>
          <p>Authors who have used generative AI in the research and writing process for their work according to OLH's appropriate use cases (given in full in our <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/ai-policy/">Artificial Intelligence Policy</a>) should note that all generative AI outputs are the responsibility of the author and the author must claim responsibility for and have full oversight of any use(s) of generative AI in their research. This is because generative AI is not a person and does not have the legal agency to hold its own copyright or to be considered a (co-)author. Please see our <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/ai-policy/">AI Policy</a> in full for further information on the acceptable use cases of generative AI.</p>
          <h4>vi) Ethical oversight.</h4>
          <p>Research involving human subjects, human material, or human data,
          must have been performed in accordance with the <a
          href="https://www.wma.net/policies-post/wma-declaration-of-helsinki-ethical-principles-for-medical-research-involving-human-subjects/">Declaration of Helsinki</a>. Where applicable, the
          studies must have been approved by an appropriate ethics committee and the
          authors should include a statement within the article text detailing this
          approval, including the name of the ethics committee and reference number of
          the approval. Authors are expected to follow their institutional policies for
          research ethics. For most research involving human subjects, informed consent
          to participate in the study should be obtained from participants (or their parent
          or guardian in the case of children under 16).</p>
          <p>Editors are expected to identify any ethical issues with submissions as soon as possible, ideally prior to peer review. We also expect for peer reviewers to comment on any ethical problems perceived within submissions.</p>

          <h3 id="publisher-responsibilities">Responsibilities of the publisher.</h3>
          <h4>i) Upholding complaints of misconduct.</h4>
          <p>The publisher (OLH) is ultimately responsible for dealing swiftly and ethically with
          allegations of editorial misconduct, plagiarism, or any other complaints related
          to the fraudulent publication of an article. This may, for example, result in
          following the corrections, retractions and removals policy (see the
          ‘<a href="#publication-ethics-and-malpractice">Publication
            Ethics</a>’ section above) in close contact with the journal’s editors to ensure that
          problems are resolved. The publisher will not tolerate misconduct by journal
          editors or authors when publishing research (here defined as a breach of the
          points set out in ‘Responsibilities of the Editors’ and ‘Responsibilities
          of the Author(s)’ below) and will not knowingly allow for such misconduct
          to persist once identified. The publisher has robust internal policies in place
          to deal with any instances of misconduct and malpractice and reviews these
          policies regularly.</p>
          <h4>ii) Availability of published content.</h4>
          <p>The OLH is committed to ensuring that all research published by OLH is available for users to openly access in perpetuity. For journals that have ceased to be published by the OLH, the content that was published under the OLH will continue to exist as fully open access and the journal's site will remain online as an archive. Back content published by other publishers prior to the journal's publication with the OLH are subject to the terms of those publishers and may not be available to access on the journal's OLH-hosted site.</p>
          <h3 id="editor-responsibilities">Responsibilities of the editors.</h3>
          <h4>i) Independence and disclosure of competing interests.</h4>
          <p>An editor’s judgement must not be influenced by any organisation, agency,
          institution or government that is external to the journal and seeks to manipulate
          an editorial decision.</p>
          <p>Editors must always withdraw from overseeing editorial processes for an article for
          which they have any potential conflicts of interest. These may be competitive
          or financial in nature, or concern relationships with or connections to the
          author(s) that would make their editorial position inappropriate. If any
          instance of competing interests compromises an editor’s position, the journal must remove editorial oversight of the article from that editor and assign editorial responsibility for the article to another editor.</p>
          <h4>ii) Neutrality and fairness.</h4>
          <p>Editors must assess research without undue bias. They must base their decisions on the
          academic rigour of the research, the fit of an article with the journal’s scope,
          and the overall contribution of an article to its field. Editors must never
          discriminate against an author’s personal background, ethnicity, disability, religion,
          citizenship, political alignment, sexuality, gender or otherwise; such
          behaviour will not be tolerated by the journal or the publisher.</p>
          <h4>iii) Confidentiality and theft of intellectual property.</h4>
          <p>Editors must never plagiarise the unpublished or published work of authors who have
          submitted to the journal. The author’s intellectual property, such as their
          argument, ideas, and text, must be considered privileged, confidential
          information and should not be used by an editor elsewhere for personal gain. An
          author’s personal information and data must remain confidential to the
          editorial team, including any submitted articles and accompanying notes.</p>
          <h4>iv) Editorial decisions.</h4>
          <p>Editors are responsible for ensuring that the established editorial policies of the
          journal are enacted at all parts of the workflow. If a problematic article
          falls outside the remit of established journal policy, editors should confer
          with one another to resolve the situation where possible. There must be
          transparency within the editorial team over the editorial decisions taken. For
          transparency, all actioned editorial decisions for an article must be logged on
          the OLH’s in-house Janeway journal publishing system.
          <a href="/site/janeway">Janeway</a> is under
          active development to ensure that editorial decisions,
          notes and other workflow actions are available for other editors to see at any
          point in the article’s passage through the journal’s workflow. The publisher
          maintains oversight of all editorial decisions within the workflow.</p>
          <p>Editors must not use generative AI to make any editorial decisions for them; generative AI does not have the legal agency to do so. Editors must give their own due scrutiny to each submission made to their journal and this includes making all editorial decisions for submitted work. Please see our <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/ai-policy/">Artificial Intelligence Policy</a> in full for further information.</p>
          <h4>v) Conduct and behaviour.</h4>
          <p>Editors are expected to uphold the highest standards of good and amicable conduct in their working relationships with authors, editors, reviewers, and with the publisher. Editors must raise any issues in the journal's editorial workflow with other parties swiftly and clearly, without causing any undue animosity. Editors are also expected to behave ethically and responsibly throughout the publishing workflow. Any allegations of abusive or otherwise concerning behaviour from editors towards other parties must be raised with the publisher.</p>
          <h4>vi) Compliance with investigations.</h4>
          <p>If a problematic situation arises and an editor is to be investigated for their
          involvement in any alleged misconduct, they must be compliant with the due
          process undertaken by the journal and/or publisher. If an editor is found to
          have breached their responsibilities, they should be removed from the journal’s
          editorial board.</p>
          <p>Editors should lead investigations into allegations of plagiarism, inaccurate academic
          content, or ethical concerns in published and unpublished manuscripts. Many
          investigative procedures into misconduct can be found in <a href="https://publicationethics.org/guidance?f%5B0%5D=type%3A16">flowcharts on COPE's website</a>, and editors must investigate every allegation of malpractice raised. If such allegations, once investigated,
          are proven to be correct, then adequate and robust action must be taken by the
          journal editors and/or publisher to remedy the problem immediately. More
          information can be found on the journal’s complaints and appeals process in the
          ‘Publication Ethics’ section above.</p>
          <h4>vii) Citation manipulation, coercive citation manipulation and data falsification.</h4>
          <p>Editors should exercise their discretion as to whether an
          excessive amount of self-citation by the author or citation of an
          individual or journal has been used upon the submission of an
          article. If it is clear the author has done so, then this is grounds
          for the rejection of their article. If citation manipulation is found
          to have occurred post-publication, then the editorial team should
          conduct a full investigation, which may lead to the correction,
          retraction or removal of the article from the journal.</p>
          <p>Editors should not engage whatsoever in coercive citation
          manipulation, such as pressuring an author to cite a particular
          person’s work or the editor’s own work unnecessarily through article
          revisions. Such activity is considered editorial malpractice and will
          result in a thorough investigation and potentially the editor’s
          removal from the editorial team should they be found to have engaged
          in coercive behaviour.</p>
          <p>Editors must be mindful of the practice of coercive citation
          manipulation in peer-review reports. If a reviewer submits a peer
          review report exhibiting such malpractice, editors must immediately
          seek another peer reviewer and prevent the problematic review report
          from being seen by the author. Editors should also avoid asking the
          reviewer to provide a peer review for the journal in the future.</p>
          <p>Data falsification (manipulation of data to suit an author’s
          argument) is a form of malpractice which editors should be aware of when assessing manuscripts. Complaints regarding data falsification
          should be taken seriously by the journal’s editorial team and the
          publisher, and should be investigated thoroughly. For published
          articles, this may lead to a correction, retraction or the removal of
          an article from the journal.</p>
          <h3 id="reviewer-responsibilities">Responsibilities of reviewers.</h3>
          <h4>i) Academic best practice.</h4>
          <p>Peer review is a vital part of the academic publishing process. As such, peer reviewers should be reminded that the highest academic rigour must be applied to any manuscript under review. A peer reviewer’s expertise is a precious resource, and researchers publishing in academic journals should consider reviewing the work of others where possible for the shared benefit of the wider academic community.</p>
          <h4>ii) Disclosure of competing interests.</h4>
          <p>If a prospective reviewer has any reason to believe that they recognise and/or have any connection to the title, abstract, or content of the manuscript they have been asked to review, they must immediately raise this with the journal’s editors. While the OLH realises that in smaller or intersecting subfields it can be difficult to maintain anonymous review, we encourage all journals operating double- or triple-anonymous peer review to assess peer reviewer concerns about anonymity and to make a judgement on the appropriateness of the peer reviewer following the journal’s own peer review policies.</p>
          <h4>iii) Confidentiality and theft of intellectual property.</h4>
          <p>Reviewers must keep all details of the manuscript they are reviewing confidential.</p>
          <p>The ideas, arguments and written content of the manuscript must not be used by the reviewer for any purpose that constitutes personal gain, such as passing it off as their own research. This extends to reviewers who have declined to review but have seen part of the research, such as the abstract or manuscript title.</p>
          <h4>iv) Conducting reviews.</h4>
          <p>Peer reviewers should let editors know as soon as possible if they require extra
          time to complete a review. If this is not acceptable, the editor may withdraw
          the invitation to review and seek another peer reviewer. Completed reviews
          should be returned promptly, at least within the deadline specified by the
          editor.</p>
          <p>Peer-review reports should be structured clearly, with full explanations given for
          areas of the manuscript that need work. Personal and unduly harsh criticism of
          the author is inappropriate and should not be included in the review. If this
          occurs, the journal’s editors should seek another peer reviewer to undertake
          review of the article.</p>
          <p>In the case of anonymous review, peer reviewers should
          also not leave any identifying information in reports, such as their name, or
          indicating that their own publication(s) should be consulted. If such
          information is detected in anonymous peer-review reports, editors must edit the
          report to remove the identifying text before the author sees it. For review reports being submitted as electronic text files, please see OLH's guidance on '<a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/anonreview/">Ensuring an Anonymous Review</a>' for further information on how to anonymise electronic documents.</p>
          <p>Reviewers should conduct reviews with as much supporting evidence for their claims as possible, to avoid undue subjective bias. Any relevant sources that the author has failed to cite should be suggested where possible and an explanation of their relevance should be given. If a reviewer has concerns about the manuscript, such as plagiarism of or similarity to another’s work, they must contact the editors immediately with an explanation of their concerns.</p>
          <p>Reviewers must not use generative AI to fabricate peer review reports for author submissions. Should a reviewer be found to be using generative AI to fabricate a peer review report, the journal editor(s) will disregard the review in the editorial decision-making process for the article. For further information on acceptable and unacceptable uses of generative AI for reviewers, please see OLH's full <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/ai-policy/">Artificial Intelligence Policy</a>.</p>
          <h4>v) Coercive citation manipulation.</h4>
          <p>Reviewers should not engage in coercive citation manipulation
          practices in which they suggest that an author should revise their
          manuscript to excessively cite or refer to, for example, the
          reviewer’s own work or the work of a journal or research group they
          are involved with. Should a peer-review report be returned by a
          reviewer that exhibits such behaviour, the peer-review report will
          not be used for editorial judgements or revisions by the author, and
          the reviewer will not be asked to provide further reviews for the
          journal.</p>
          <h3 id="author-responsibilities">Responsibilities of the author(s).</h3>
          <h4>i) Academic standards.</h4>
          <p>Authors should adhere to the journal’s submission guidelines when submitting a manuscript for consideration. All articles should fall within the focus and scope of the journal and adhere to the journal's accepted author style guidelines.</p>
          <p>All research articles must contain adequate citations and references that support the arguments being made. This is to ensure that all research is of the required standard to be considered for publication. Authors should neither knowingly present inaccurate information or data, nor present arguments that are deliberately misleading.</p>
          <h4>ii) Original research and theft of intellectual property.</h4>
          <p>Authors have the responsibility to ensure that their research is genuinely original and not plagiarised or very similar to work that is either already published or known to them as being in the process of publication. Any work that is found to be plagiarised, or research that infringes upon another person’s intellectual property and has not been adequately credited, should not be passed off as the author’s own work. If the work of others has informed the author’s research, this work must be properly credited through citation and referencing.</p>
          <p>A research manuscript must not be submitted concurrently to multiple journals for consideration. Authors should wait for the result of submission to an OLH journal before submitting their article to another journal.</p>
          <h4>iii) Disclosure of competing interests.</h4>
          <p>Authors are responsible for disclosing any <a
            href="/site/competing-interests/">competing
            interests</a> at the point of an article’s
          submission, which will then be listed on the final published article. Failure
          to disclose competing interests may result in the journal being unable to
          publish the article, even if it passes peer review.</p>
          <h4>iv) Manuscript revisions and editorial compliance.</h4>
          <p>Authors must endeavour to make all necessary revisions to their manuscripts following peer
          review feedback. If authors are not able to make the necessary changes to their
          article, this may result in the article’s rejection. If their article is
          accepted for publication, authors should be amenable to copyediting queries and
          further suggested changes prior to the article’s publication.</p>
          <h4>v) Allegations by a third party, investigations, and notification of errors.</h4>
          <p>Authors may be approached by the journal’s editors in the event that the editorial team receives information from a third party relating to the accuracy and integrity of an article. In the event of any alleged malpractice made by a third party, the journal’s editors must conduct an investigation in consultation with the publisher. The author's institution where their research was conducted may also be contacted as necessary in such investigations. If the allegation is upheld as a result of this investigation, the author will be asked to respond. The author’s cooperation during this process is appreciated and the journal editors and publisher will make every effort to seek an adequate and amicable solution to resolve the situation and uphold the integrity of the journal’s research. The publisher and journal editors may need to take remedial steps to ensure that the author’s work is either corrected, retracted or removed from the journal (see the ‘Publication Ethics’ section above).</p>
          <p>If the author realises that, post-publication, their work contains either
          fundamental or minor errors, the journal’s editor must be notified immediately so
          that the process for article correction/retraction/removal can begin, adhering
          to the publisher’s policy.</p>
          <h4>vi) Citation manipulation, coercive citation manipulation and data falsification.</h4>
          <p>Authors should not engage in excessive citation of their own work, or an over-reliance on the research of any single author when constructing their own argument and writing their original research. An example of this would be recycling many quotations of a pre-existing publication by the author in their newly submitted research, or citing another researcher’s original work throughout the manuscript to the extent that the author’s own argument is lacking. Authors should also not cite solely to raise the citation frequency of any journal, or of any individual.</p>
          <p>If an author suspects that the journal’s editor is pressuring them to include citations or references to work that is the editor’s own, or by a journal that the editor has engagement with in a way that the author believes to be unnecessarily coercive, they should inform the journal’s Editor-in-Chief immediately, or the publisher, so that a full investigation can take place into the alleged misconduct.</p>
          <p>Authors should not, where any data is given, knowingly amend or alter it to suit their own analyses or argument. Such falsification of data is serious and will result in a malpractice investigation which may lead to article rejection, correction, retraction or removal from the journal.</p>
          <h4>vii) The use of generative AI.</h4>
          <p>Authors must read and abide by OLH's <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/ai-policy/">Artificial Intelligence Policy</a> in full before submitting work to an OLH journal. Authors must adhere to acceptable and responsible uses of generative AI in their research, and they must determine whether they need to make an 'AI Declaration Statement' as indicated by OLH's policy for the transparency of research methods and for ethical best practice. Authors assume full responsibility of all generative AI outputs, in all cases, and must have oversight of all acceptable generative AI uses as stated in our full <a href="https://www.openlibhums.org/site/ai-policy/">AI Policy</a>.</p>
          <h3 id="authorship-and-contributorship">Authorship and contributorship.</h3>
          <p>Articles should list names of all those who contributed to the published work, to ensure
          transparency and the academic integrity of the research. Authors take
          collective responsibility for determining who should be listed as an author and
          the order in which they should appear when listed. Individuals who have contributed to the
          article, but do not meet the full criteria for authorship, should be credited
          by name and affiliation in the ‘Acknowledgments’ section. </p>
          <p>The OLH strongly encourages all authors to register for
          an <a href="https://orcid.org/">Open Researcher and Contributor ID (ORCID)</a> prior
          to submitting their work. ORCID provides a persistent digital
          identifier that authors own and control (an ORCID), which distinguishes them
          from every other researcher. ORCIDs will be displayed on published articles
          when they are provided by the author.</p>
          <p>The <a href="https://www.icmje.org/recommendations/browse/roles-and-responsibilities/defining-the-role-of-authors-and-contributors.html">International
            Committee of Medical Journal Editors (ICMJE)</a> recommends the
          following criteria for authorship:</p>
          <ul class="browser-default">
           <li>Substantial contributions to the conception or design of the
               work; or the acquisition, analysis, or interpretation of data for the
               work; AND</li>
           <li>Drafting the work or revising it critically for important
               intellectual content; AND</li>
           <li>Final approval of the version to be published; AND</li>
           <li>Agreement to be accountable for all aspects of the work in
               ensuring that questions related to the accuracy or integrity of any part
               of the work are appropriately investigated and resolved.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Where an article has multiple authors, there should be one primary author contact
          responsible for dealing with all editorial and publishing queries prior to and
          after the article’s publication. They must consult with their co-editors and
          contributors about editorial and publishing queries where appropriate, in order
          to facilitate an article’s publication. Post-publication, co-authors may wish
          to include their corresponding email address so that it is visible on the
          article.</p>
          <p>All authors must give their approval before being attributed to the submitted
          article. The primary author must ensure that other co-authors have consulted
          the above sections, and in particular,
          ‘<a href="#author-responsibilities">Responsibilities of the Author(s)</a>’.</p>
          <p>The ‘Acknowledgements’ section of an article must include the involvement of
          research groups or organisations and any funding sources. All named figures and
          sources must give their permission to be acknowledged by the author(s) as this
          can be construed as an association with, and endorsement of, the research.</p>
          <p>Authors cannot be added or removed at any point prior to publication unless an adequate
          reason is given to editors for why this is necessary. The unjustified addition or
          removal of authors will be considered a case of malpractice and will not be
          tolerated by the journal and publisher should an investigation prove this to be
          true.</p>
          <p>Where editors wish to incorporate the <a href="https://credit.niso.org/">Contributor
          Roles Taxonomy (CRediT)</a> system to acknowledge different models of contribution, this is
          permitted on a case-by-case basis.</p>
          <p>The authorship or co-authorship of an article cannot be attributed to generative AI models or any other generative AI tools or technologies; generative AI is not considered a legal entity and does not meet the criteria for authorship in any capacity. Submitting authors are responsible for all generative AI uses, oversight, and outputs in their research.
