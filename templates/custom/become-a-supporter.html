          <p>We are not a subscription publisher, charging fees for exclusive
          access to our journals. Instead, your investment funds
          33 open access journals
          in the humanities, with no author-facing charges,
          making them accessible to anyone with an internet connection.</p>
          <p>By supporting us, you join over 340 libraries worldwide who are
          taking a stand against exploitative commercial publishing practices
          to invest in progressive change in scholarly communications. As more
          libraries join our partnership network, we divert library budgets
          away from commercial subscriptions. This redistributes library
          investment towards a not-for-profit, academic-led publishing
          future.</p>
          <p>Standard-level OLH membership sustains our publishing activities
          and helps build open-source publishing technologies that benefit the
          entire academic community. In 2022, we published and funded a total
          of 469 articles across journals. These publications were
          downloaded 1,122,354 times and viewed 2,539,747 times.
          We now publish 33 journals
          and 4 journals are archived.
          </p>
          <p>Higher-level OLH membership helps us expand. We use these funds to
          rescue high-profile titles that are at risk from ceasing publication
          due to austerity cuts to humanities research funding. Higher-level
          membership also enables us to flip more subscription journals to
          diamond open access.</p>
          <p>Flipping journals strengthens libraries’ bargaining power with
          large commercial publishers. This puts pressure on these publishers
          to adopt more  transparent business models and reduce their fees to
          reflect the realities of library budgets.</p>

          <p>The OLH has proven that it is possible to publish high-quality
          humanities scholarship at an affordable cost. We’ve shown that
          bringing publishing technology in house, under academic control, does
          not compromise quality. Our publishing platform Janeway removes the
          profit margins of commercial infrastructure providers. This generates
          substantial savings to the library partners that financially support
          us.</p>
          <p>OLH journal articles benefit from the latest advances in online
          journal publishing – with strong discoverability, robust digital
          preservation, and high quality presentation. All OLH content is
          registered with and assigned a Digital Object Identifier and our
          journals are indexed in the Directory of Open Access (DOAJ) and many
          key indexers. Journal information is harvested by Google Scholar and
          metadata is available for harvesting via OAI-PMH.</p>
          <p>This means that our journal content is discoverable for
          researchers using library catalogues at your institution. However,
          content is also available for the benefit of all who have an internet
          connection, regardless of geographical location or financial means.
          You can read more about the preservation, discoverability and
          accessibility of our journal content by downloading our

          <p>Since launching in 2013 as a scholar-led movement, the OLH has
          worked closely with library allies to build an alternative model to
          commercial journal subscriptions. In recognition of this partnership
          between scholars and librarians, all library members are given a
          governance stake in the OLH.
          <a href="/site/governance-and-finances/#library-board">The Library Board</a>
          is one of three advisory boards
          elected to represent our membership interests and vote on strategic

          materials including campaign posters, videos, infographics, and
          reading lists. We also provide links to other organisations that

          <p>There are other ways you can support the OLH, in addition to
          membership. Recommending OLH journals to scholars in your institution
          can raise academic awareness about scholar-led and not-for-profit
          publishing models. We encourage you to suggest our
          33 journals to
          your academics for their publications and use on university
          curricula. We also welcome expressions of interest to write for our
          <a href="/news/tag/Open%20Insights/"
             target="_blank">Open Insights</a> blog series, which contains
           guest-written posts, interviews, and provocations about open
           access.</p>
