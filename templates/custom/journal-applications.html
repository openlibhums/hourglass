            Prestigious, community-minded publishing.
          </h2>
          <p>Since 2013, the OLH has become one of the most prestigious diamond
          open-access publishers of humanities journals. If your application is
          successful, you will become part of a powerful global community of
          like-minded scholars who are using open access to address structural
          inequalities within our disciplines. We focus on community ownership and
          not-for-profit principles, standing against commercial acquisition by
          publishers preoccupied with their own profit margins. You can read more
          about our sector-leading standards for preservation, discoverability and
          governance by downloading our Journals Brochure.</p>
          <p>Our publishing model is built on the concept of migrating titles from
          commercial publishers to enable journals to publish open access. Our tech
          team have years of experience developing the bespoke technical tools
          required to make the move from your previous publisher happen
          smoothly.</p>
