          <h2>Governance</h2>
          <p>The OLH is governed by a Board of Trustees and three advisory boards. The boards meet bi-annually to review the OLH’s overall performance, discuss research and development for different user groups, vote on strategic issues, and liaise with relevant stakeholders.

As part of Birkbeck, we receive organisational support in the day-to-running of the OLH.</p>
          <p>Trustees are nominated by the OLH management team and elected by the Board of Trustees, serving a 5-year renewable term. Members of the three advisory boards (Academic Advisory Board, Library Board, and Publishing Technology Board) are elected and serve a 3-year renewable term.</p>

The Board ensures the good governance of the OLH, maintaining the high ethical reputation of the organisation, overseeing the delivery of the OLH’s mission, and advising on policies and strategy. The Board meets biannually and is available for consultation between meetings.</p>

          <h3>Publishing revenue</h3>
          <p>Several revenue streams fund the publishing costs at the OLH.</p>
          <p>The OLH Library Partnership Subsidy (LPS) was set up in 2015 when the OLH launched as an open-access publisher of humanities journals. Since 2015, we have built up a loyal LPS membership list of 335 university libraries worldwide, with support from library consortia in the US (LYRASIS) and the UK (JISC), and national-level funding councils including The Austrian Science Fund (FWF), the Ministry of Education in Greece, the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC), the Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (Sweden), and the UK’s Wellcome Trust. LPS members contribute via an annual subsidy payment that is <a href="http://systems/plugins/supporters/site/library-partnership-fees/">banded according to institutional size</a>, with options for higher-tier members.&nbsp;</p>
          <p>We also generate income through the OLH’s in-house publishing platform Janeway, which launched in early 2018. Our tech team provide bespoke publishing solutions and customer support for 26 university clients. Since 2018, Janeway has established itself as a leading player in digital publishing, offering affordable publishing solutions through innovations in software, automation, and bespoke digital packages.</p>
          <p>The OLH is also active in pursuing grant funding for ongoing research and development. To date, the OLH has received funding from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (an initial planning grant of £90,000 was awarded in April 2014 and a follow-on grant of $741,000 was awarded in July 2015) Arcadia ($200,000 awarded in May 2021).</p>
