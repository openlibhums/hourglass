          <p>The OLH is governed by three advisory boards, the Academic
          Advisory Board, Library Board, and Publishing Technology Board. The
          boards meet bi-annually to review the OLH’s overall performance,
          discuss research and development for different user groups, vote on
          strategic issues, and liaise with relevant stakeholders. We are part
          of Birkbeck, University of London, a UK higher education institution
          incorporated by Royal Charter (England/Wales). As part of Birkbeck,
          we receive organisational support in the day-to-running of the
          OLH.</p>
          <p>Members of the boards are elected and serve a 3-year renewable
          term.</p>
          <h3 id="academic-advisory-board">Academic Advisory Board</h3>
          <p>The Academic Advisory Board provides expert advice to the OLH
          Executive Director and the OLH team. Board members are leading
          academics, publishing professionals, and university leaders
          representing the humanities scholarly communities that the OLH
          serves. Members are elected to the Board for renewable terms of 3
          years and meet annually at a virtual board. They may be called upon
          to help the OLH gather new insights into organisational or strategic
          questions, questions of scholarly rigour, provide discipline-specific
          advice, or otherwise consult on matters of best practice.</p>
          <h3 id="library-board">Library Board</h3>
          <p>The Library Board constitutes the community-based library
          governance of the OLH’s financial model. The Board provides expert
          advice to the OLH Executive Director and the OLH team on all matters
          relating to library membership. Board members are university and
          public library professionals as well as data management specialists
          elected to the board for 3-year renewable terms by the OLH library
          community (every participating member of the Library Partnership
          Subsidy, which financially supports the publishing activities of the
          OLH). The Board meets annually at a virtual board and may be
          consulted between boards on specific questions, issues, or tasks
          relating to library members’ needs.</p>

          publishing technologies and tools. Board members are publishing
          professionals, library professionals, open-access and open-source

          terms of 3 years and meet annually at a virtual board; to be held in

          <p>The OLH was originally founded as a company limited by guarantee
          based in the UK. It was set up in July 2013 and directed by
          co-founders Prof. Martin Eve and Dr Caroline Edwards. In September
          2015, the OLH became a registered charity under UK law overseen by a
          Board of Trustees.</p>
          <p>To safeguard against the possibility of commercial acquisition, in
          2021 the Board of Trustees decided that merging with Birkbeck,
          University of London would protect the OLH’s not-for-profit
          mission.</p>
          <p>When it formally merged with Birkbeck, University of London in May
          2022, the OLH ceased to operate as an independent charity and became
          part of Birkbeck’s charitable status. Birkbeck, University of London
          is an exempt charity under the terms of the Charities Act 2011
          incorporated by Royal Charter (England/Wales), number RC000048, and
          does not have a ‘registered charity number’.</p>

          <p>The OLH is incorporated into Birkbeck, University of
          London. Under the terms of the UK Charities Act 2011
          Birkbeck is regulated by the Office for Students (OfS)
          and is accountable to the OfS for fulfilling its obligations
          under UK charity law. OLH income and expenditure is
          audited as part of Birkbeck’s annual financial
          statements released in Autumn each year.</p>
          <p>As a not-for-profit organisation, surplus income is
          reinvested back into the OLH. This includes rising staff
          costs, investing in software development, and
          contributing to organisational support at Birkbeck,
          where the OLH team is based.</p>

          <h3 id="publishing-revenue">Publishing revenue</h3>
          <p>Several revenue streams fund the publishing costs at the OLH.</p>
          <p>The OLH Library Partnership Subsidy (LPS) was set up in 2015 when
          the OLH launched as an open-access publisher of humanities journals.
          Since 2015, we have built up a loyal LPS membership list of 345
          university libraries worldwide, with support from library consortia
          in the US (LYRASIS) and the UK (JISC), and national-level funding
          councils including The Austrian Science Fund (FWF), the Ministry of
          Education in Greece, the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC),
          the Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (Sweden), and the UK’s Wellcome Trust.
          LPS members contribute via an annual subsidy payment that is <a
          href="/plugins/supporters/site/library-partnership-fees/">banded
          according to institutional size</a>, with options for higher-tier
          members.</p>
          <p>We also generate income through the OLH’s in-house publishing
          platform Janeway, which launched in early 2018. Our tech team provide
          bespoke publishing solutions and customer support for 26 university
          clients. Since 2018, Janeway has established itself as a leading
          player in digital publishing, offering affordable publishing
          solutions through innovations in software, automation, and bespoke
          digital packages.</p>
          <p>The OLH is also active in pursuing grant funding for ongoing
          research and development. To date, the OLH has received funding from
          the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation (an initial planning grant of £90,000
          was awarded in April 2014 and a follow-on grant of $741,000 was
          awarded in July 2015) Arcadia ($200,000 awarded in May 2021).</p>
